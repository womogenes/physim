# N-body simulation data

All data here was generated with a naive O(n^2) n-body solver.

## Generation

Run `./data_generation.py` to create the `./data/` directory. It will generate a number of files:

```
data-gen/data/
  n_512_dt_0.1_F_512/
    - 000000.pt
    - 000001.pt
    - 000002.pt
    ...
```

Each file describes a timeline (i.e. a single run of $n$ particles). Components of the parent directory's name:

- `n_512` means 512 particles
- `dt_0.1` means the timestep is 0.1 per frame
- `F_512` means 512 frames per timeline

## Loading

To load a file using PyTorch:

```py
import torch
data = torch.load("path/to/data/dir/n_512_dt_0.1_F_512_000000.pt")
```

`data` will be a dictionary of floats/tensors that describe the timeline. `n` is the number of particles, `dt` is the timestep, `F` is the length of the timeline in frames, and `G` is the gravitational constant.

```py
{
    "dt": 0.1,
    "G": 100,
    "m": tensor(...)  # tensor of masses        shape: (n,)
    "X": tensor(...)  # tensor of positions     shape: (F, n, 2)
    "V": tensor(...)  # tensor of velocities    shape: (F, n, 2)
}
```
